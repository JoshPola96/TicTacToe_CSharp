# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a basic console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in C# as a practice while working on a C# certification course. The game allows two players to play against each other on the same machine.

## Features

- **Two Players**: Players alternate turns to make a move.
- **Game Board**: A 3x3 grid where players can place their markers.
- **Win Check**: Automatically checks for a winner after each move.
- **Draw Detection**: Detects if the game ends in a draw.
- **Game Reset**: Option to restart the game after a win or draw.

## How to Run

1. **Compile and Run**: Open the solution in a C# compatible IDE (e.g., Visual Studio). Build and run the project.
2. **Play**: Follow the on-screen prompts to choose a spot on the board. The board updates after each move, and you will be notified of the gameâ€™s outcome.

## Code Overview

- **`Main` Method**: Manages the game loop, player turns, and game state.
- **`GetValidMove` Method**: Prompts the player for a move and ensures it is valid.

## Notes
